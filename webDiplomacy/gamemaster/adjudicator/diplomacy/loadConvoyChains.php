		/*
		 * There are 3 steps to creating the convoy chains:
		 * - Load all the armies which want to be convoyed
		 *   - If the army doesn't have any convoys set it to hold or move via land if it can
		 *   - $startPositions = array(
		 * 				array('id'=>$convoyedID,
		 * 					'terrID'=>$convoyedTerrID,
		 * 					'toTerrID'=>$convoyedToTerrID,
		 * 					'convoyCount'=>$convoyingUnitNo)
		 * 			);
		 *
		 * - For each army that wants to be convoyed load all of its convoys
		 *   - An array, indexed by move ID, linking to the all adjacent convoys
		 *   - If the convoy is at the start or end of the chain then linkNode is 'Start' or 'End,
		 * 		instead of being the next $moveID
		 *   - If the convoy is the start of the convoy it is placed in the $startConvoys array, which
		 *     is indexed by the move ID of the army which is moving out
		 *   - The convoy's dislodged status is saved, so that non-dislodged convoys do not need to
		 *     be processed
		 *
		 * - For each convoy start the convoy links are recursively traversed to find the end node.
		 *   - An array is made with a structure which contains convoy IDs, and arrays. Each array
		 *     is a sub-convoy-chain, and each convoy ID represents a convoy which may be dislodged,
		 *     but which must not be dislodged for the current chain to be traversed. So to go down
		 *     a sub-convoy-chain you must first make sure all the convoy IDs in that sub-convoy-chain
		 *     are not dislodged
		 *   - When a chain ends it returns an empty array, so a convoy chain may look like this:
		 * 		array(123, 234, 345, array(123, array()), array(1029, 1293, array())
		 *   - If a convoy chain ends without finding the end-node it returns false, in which case the
		 *     current chain is discarded, and alternate paths may be found.
		 *   - This gives two scenarios: The one above, where there is a convoy chain with some units
		 *     which may not be dislodged. Or a failed chain which has no complete path to the end.
		 *     Or a successful chain which is complete and contains no dislodged units, and can be
		 *     used immidiately.
		 *   - If the chain is unsuccessful it will not be in the final $chains array, the army will
		 *     be set to hold or move via land, and all the convoys will fail.
		 *   - If the chain is possible it will be in the $chains array, and it will be given later to
		 *     an adjConvoyMove object to process
		 *   - If the chain has succeeded an empty array will be in the $chains array, which will also
		 *     be given to an adjConvoyMove later, and the adjConvoyMove will recognize that it is
		 *     successful without processing it.
		 *   - While traversing the convoy chains looking for paths all convoys which are used have a
		 *     ->used flag set. If they fail, or are not used, they are set to hold and un-needed.
		 *
		 * - Once the valid convoy chains are collected everything else is set to not move or not move
		 *   via convoy.
		 *
		 * - The final product is $convoyChains, which contains all the valid chains of convoys, and is
		 *   indexed by the move ID of the starting army. All
		 *   successful chains are just empty arrays, unsuccessful chains aren't included.
		 *
		 * - So valid starting armies -> valid starting convoys -> valid convoy chains
		 *   -> filter out non-valid convoys
		 *
		 * Any convoying units which are not convoying for any reason are set to Hold. Any moving
		 * units which were going viaConvoy, but could not, are set to viaConvoy='No', and if they are
		 * not adjacent to the territory they were moving to they are set to path='No'
