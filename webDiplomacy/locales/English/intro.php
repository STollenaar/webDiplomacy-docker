Diplomacy is a game which is easy to learn but impossible to master. The rules are all very intuitive,
lots of people pick them up just by playing, but this document will familiarize you more quickly.

<p>webDiplomacy, as a community, is a competitive and fun place to play. Currently we have two site supported ranking systems. </p>

<a name="RR"></a>
<h3>RR</h3>
<p>
The first is our “Reliability Rating” (RR); this ranking is determined based on how often you fail to enter
 moves in a turn (NMR/No Moves Received) or leave a game before it’s conclusion (CD/Civil Disorder). Most tournaments, special rules games, 
 or high stakes games have RR restrictions; meaning if you leave games often or irresponsibly forget to enter 
 moves frequently you may find it hard to join competitive games. 
<br /><br />

<div class="hr"></div>

<a name="Points"></a>
<h3>Points</h3>
<p>
The second system is our point system (<img src="images/icons/points.png" alt="D" title="webDiplomacy points">), which is used to determine how many 
games you can join and what stakes the game will be. You start with 100 <img src="images/icons/points.png" alt="D" title="webDiplomacy points"> and are 
reimbursed whenever a loss of points results in you having less than 100 <img src="images/icons/points.png" alt="D" title="webDiplomacy points">. 
Points are fun and provide a tangible reward for winning but are far less important to your 
ability to play fun and enthralling games on webDiplomacy. Many of our tournaments are unranked, 
and those that aren’t are usually willing to play at lower <img src="images/icons/points.png" alt="D" title="webDiplomacy points"> levels for players with very high Reliability Ratings.

<a name="Objective"></a>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
The objective of Diplomacy is to be the first to get 18 supply centers. For each supply center
you occupy you get a new unit, and you lose a unit whenever a supply center you own gets
occupied by someone else.<br /><br />
You can recognize the supply centers with the markers which are placed on them.</p>

	In diplomacy no army or fleet is stronger than another, and a <strong>holding</strong>
	unit will always beat a <strong>moving</strong> unit of equal support.

	The only way to win a battle is by supporting a <strong>moving</strong> unit with another unit, using a yellow
