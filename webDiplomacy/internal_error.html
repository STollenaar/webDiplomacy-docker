	webDiplomacy's web server experienced a problem while loading the requested page.

<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>
webDiplomacy has encountered an internal server error while loading the page you requested. This is due to server conditions outside of webDiplomacy's control; typically the web server/database server is experiencing unusually high load, because one of the many websites being hosted by the same server as ours is using more than its share of resources.
</p>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h3>What should I do?</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Try waiting a while and <a href="javascript:location.reload(true)" class="light">refreshing</a> a few times; the server may be experiencing a short temporary spike in activity.</li>
<li>Try checking <a class="light" href="http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/">http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/</a> for information on outages which Dreamhost either planned or have been informed of (we use servers: <a href="http://feeds.dreamhoststatus.com/?q=spacey+mrpibb+lander+shiloh" class="light">mrpibb, lander, spacey and shiloh</a>).</li>
<li>If you are seeing this page continuously, and Dreamhost aren't reporting any problems, e-mail <a class="light" href="mailto:kestas.j.k@gmail.com?Subject=webDiplomacy-500-error">kestas.j.k@gmail.com</a> (subject "webDiplomacy-500-error") and I will contact Dreamhost (assuming the error is still occurring when I get it).</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>I keep getting this error, but have orders to submit!</h3>
<p>
webDiplomacy runs on shared hosting as a hobbyist project, and unfortunately occasional problems like this are an inevitable consequence, but systems are in place to reduce the impact:<br /><br />
The GameMaster keeps track of when it was last active (usually less than 5 minutes), and will suspend all processing when it detects that it has been offline for more than 30 minutes.<br />
This means that if the system has been down for more than 30 minutes games will not move onto the next turn until time has been added to compensate for the downtime, or the game has been paused for live games etc.<br /><br />
So if you have been seeing only this page despite checking every few minutes for half an hour you don't need to worry about your games continuing without your orders when webDiplomacy comes back online.<br /><br />
<em>However</em> accounting for unexpected problems is always an imperfect process, and unaffected players/games do not want unnecessarily long time extensions; if you have orders to submit try frequently to submit them, don't rely on the safety net if you don't need to. Due to the nature of the game turns cannot be rewound for players which missed them <em>no matter what the circumstances</em>!

Sorry for the inconvenience, we hope to be back online as soon as possible.<br />
