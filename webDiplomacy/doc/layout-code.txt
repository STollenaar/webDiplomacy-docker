Layout
------
--- Main scripts
board.php is the script which generates the "Board", containing the map, chatbox, order entry form, and game summary
board/ is a folder containing board.php specific code
board/orders/ is a folder containing order code that a player will need

gamemaster.php processes games and maintains the "Logged on users" sessions table; cleaning out old users
gamemaster/ is a folder containing gamemaster.php specific code
gamemaster/adjudicator/ is a folder containing the adjudication scripts
gamemaster/adjudicator/diplomacy/ is a folder containing the Diplomacy phase specific adjudication code, as the Diplomacy
								  phase is by far the most complex phase to adjudicate 
gamemaster/orders/ is a folder containing order managing scripts; creation, archival, conversion to Moves, completion, etc

map.php draws the map and saves it to disk, as well as creating the JavaScript files which allow maps to be browsed easily
map/ is a folder containing map.php specific code

The three code sections above are the largest three code sections in phpDiplomacy, and together they do almost all of the game
related functions.

--- Other folders
mapstore/ is one of two folders which phpDip will actively create and write to. Inside this folder rendered
		  maps are saved, so that they can be displayed without having to re-draw them. Also stored are 
		  JavaScript files which allow a user to easily scroll through maps from old turns/games

errorlog-[md5-hash]/ is the other folder which gets written to. When an error occurs a variable dump and stack trace is
		  taken, and saved to a text file in this folder, which can be viewed from admincp.php.
		  The md5 hash appended to the folder prevents the error logs from being accessed publically, as it may contain 
		  sensitive data such as passwords (or more likely MD5 hashes of passwords), or orders, or private correspondence
		  This detailed logging can be enabled in config.php, as it is disabled by default

css/ contains phpDip's CSS file(s)

global/ contains miscellaneous code which is used globally, usually in the header.php; error handling, global constants
 
lib/ is a folder containing static libraries of related functions
	e.g. libHTML, libTime, libAuth, etc

objects/ is a folder containing objects which are not specific to a single page, or are used on every page
		 e.g. Database, User, Game, Member(used everywhere); 
		 Order, Territory, Unit, Convoy (used both in gamemaster/ and board/)

captcha/ contains the code which renders the easyCaptcha which is used on the registration page
contrib/ contains work from other projects which phpDip uses and is under a non-BSD compatible license
	e.g. phpMailer, the fonts used in the large map, the small/large image icons
doc/ contains developer notes
images/ contains images used in phpDip
install/ contains code which will help update phpDip from the previous version, or install phpDip from scratch
locales/ will, at some point in the future, contain the data required to view phpDiplomacy in alternate languages
