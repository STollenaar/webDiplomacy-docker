DATC Compliance
---------------

As of 0.8 phpDip passes all of the Diplomacy phase test cases which apply. Some
of the tests test whether an order parser would have problems with certain textual
orders, and these types of tests don't apply to phpDip which supplies the user with
only a valid selection of orders.


Retreats test cases haven't been attempted, most are simple but some will require
changes; such as making sure that a unit dislodged by an adjacent unit from a convoy
will be able to retreat to that units old spot.

In unit placement there is a certain rule for the order in which to remove units 
from a civil disorder player who has lost supply centers. It is a very bizarre rule
which would rarely come into play, or bother anyone if it wasn't followed, but all
these rules will eventually be followed closely.

Regarding retreats and unit placement the most important changes required in the future
will be explicitly saying which way phpDip goes with the controversial issues, and 
making sure that those controversial issues behave as expected.

 
The important things for developers to note is the datc.php script; this script will 
take data from the pD_DATC and pD_DATCOrders table to be able to cycle through all of
the test cases, and verify that everything is in order. This makes it easier for changes
to the adjudicator to be debugged.
