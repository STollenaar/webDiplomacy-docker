<p><b>Story</b></p>
<p>The country is in ruins and in a state of anarchy except 5 states where new 'Republics' have arisen. Florida, Texas and California maintain some semblance of order within their old borders. In the north-east, New York has formed a union with Pennsylvania and New Jersey to stand together in the coming wars. Chicago, Milwaukee and Minneapolis have done likewise, calling themselves the 'Heartland' of America...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the events in the United States have caused Quebec to secede from Canada. Western Canada soon followed suit, under the leadership of British Columbia and joined with American renegades in Alaska. The central Canadian government has fallen and is in disarray...</p>

<p>In the south, the increasingly strong drug lords and industrial mafia have rested control of northern Mexico away from the government, while the rebellion of Chiapas has spread to other southern Mexican states. Under siege, Mexico's government prepares to strike back...</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the chaos on the North American continent, Cuba invades Jamaica and prepares to spread its influence further abroad, while Peru takes control of Colombia and turns its eyes northwards...</p>

<p>This is the setting at the start of the Empire variant of Diplomacy, where you play one of 10 new or old nations in a bid to conquer North America. Can you lead your country to North American domination?</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>34 supply centers are required to win</li>
<li><b>Great Lakes</b> - Fleets cannot move directly from one Great Lake to another, except from Lake Michigan to Lake Huron.</li>
<li><b>Canals</b> - There are a few one-space canals that act like Kiel in Vanilla dip. This means that the spaces have no coasts and fleets can exit on any side: Panama, Ontario, Michigan, Upper Peninsula, Chicago (see below).  There is also a canal between New York City and New York State. Fleets can move from one to the other.</li>
<li><b>Waterways</b> - There are two waterways in Empire4 where fleets can move as though there were a coastline in the listed territories. These rivers do not impede army movement:
	<ul>
    <li>Mississippi (Chicago, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Deep South, Louisiana)</li>
    <li>St-Lawrence (Beauce, Montreal, NYS, Ontario, Quebec, Gaspe)</li>
	<li>For example, a fleet could move from Tennessee to any of Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas or Deep South.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Landbridges</b>
	<ul>
    <li>Units can move between Ungava and Nunavut. This does not block movement between Hudson Bay and the Sea of Labrador.</li>
    <li>Units can move between Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. This does not block movement between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
